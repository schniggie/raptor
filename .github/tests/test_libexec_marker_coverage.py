"""Verify every libexec script has the inline trust-marker check.

Why this test exists
--------------------
The trust-marker check is intentionally inlined in every libexec
script (not factored into a shared helper) so it cannot be subverted
by a single helper-module compromise and so it remains visible at the
top of every script during code review.

The cost of that decision is that future contributors who add a new
libexec script could forget to paste in the block. This test catches
that — every libexec/raptor-* file must contain the sentinel comment
``# ─── trust-marker check`` near the top, and the marker must
gate on at least one of the trusted-caller env vars.
