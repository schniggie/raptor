"""Composite risk estimate for a :class:`VulnFinding`.

Implements the multiplicative formula from ``design/sca.md`` §1246
("Risk model — calibration target for follow-up PR").

**Calibration status: unverified.** The formula's individual
multipliers are reasonable guesses informed by the components people
already use to triage CVEs (CVSS, KEV, EPSS, reachability), but the
specific weights have not yet been validated against a corpus of
known-exploited vs known-fixed-not-exploited CVEs. Operators should
treat ``raptor_risk_estimate`` as a sort key — useful for "look at
the top 10 first" — and use the component breakdown
(``risk_components``) when escalating individual findings to a real
decision.

The calibration follow-up (design §1135) will:
  1. Build a 50/50 KEV / fixed-not-exploited corpus.
  2. Run candidate formulas; pick the one that ranks exploited above
     non-exploited reliably.
  3. Re-tune the multipliers in this file.
  4. Flip the calibration status from "unverified" to "validated".

Until that lands, the formula here is the seed against which
calibration runs and the shape consumers depend on (the components
dict, the 0-100 range, the sort order).
