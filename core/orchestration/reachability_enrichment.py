"""Reachability-driven checklist enrichment for /agentic.

Sibling of :func:`core.orchestration.understand_bridge.enrich_checklist`,
which marks entry-points and sinks as ``priority=high`` based on
the /understand context-map. This module marks dead-code
functions (NOT_CALLED verdict from
``core.inventory.reachability``) as ``priority=low`` so the
/agentic LLM analysis spends its budget on functions that
actually run.

The two enrichers are complementary:

  * ``enrich_checklist`` (understand_bridge): UPGRADES priority
    based on context-map data (entry points, sinks, trust
    boundaries).
  * ``mark_unreachable_low_priority`` (this module): DOWNGRADES
    priority for functions not reached from anywhere in non-test
    project source.

When both run, ``enrich_checklist`` should run FIRST so its
``priority=high`` markers stand. This module skips functions
already marked high-priority — the entry-point analysis trumps
reachability (a function might be an externally-callable entry
point that the project itself doesn't call internally; static
reachability would say NOT_CALLED but the operator still cares).

Mutates the checklist in place. Returns the count of functions
marked low-priority, mainly for diagnostic logging.

Best-effort: any failure (inventory build error, malformed
checklist, missing call_graph data) is logged at debug and the
checklist is returned unchanged.

    upstream enrichment (from /understand context-map) takes
    precedence. ``inventory`` may be passed in by the caller
    (avoids a redundant tree walk when a sibling consumer
    already built one).

    ``allow_unreachable=True`` is the operator-opt-out for the
    in-isolation use case (CTF challenges, vendor reference
    snippets, exploit-research targets, intentional dead-code
    review). When set, NOT_CALLED functions do NOT receive the
    ``priority="low"`` demotion — the analysis prompt won't
    surface a "Verdict: NOT_CALLED" line, and the LLM is asked to
    evaluate the function's inherent vulnerability shape rather
    than its deployment reachability. Framework-callable /
    registered-via-call annotations are STILL applied (they're
    affirmative reachability evidence regardless of mode).

    Returns the count of functions marked low-priority. Zero when
    ``allow_unreachable=True`` (nothing demoted) but still mutates
