"""Per-provider auth-header injection rules.

Each provider's authentication scheme is a small fact: which headers
to strip from the worker's request, which to inject from the parent's
secret store, which upstream URL to forward to. Encoded as data so
adding a provider is a single dict entry plus a credentials-source.

Only providers RAPTOR actively dispatches to are supported here. If
``api_key`` is None at request time, the dispatcher rejects with
``503 Service Unavailable: provider not configured`` so the worker's
SDK surfaces a clear error rather than a mysterious 401 from upstream.

Most providers are bearer-auth on a known upstream URL: the rule strips
the worker's (dummy) auth header and injects the real one. **AWS
Bedrock** is the exception — it uses sigv4 request signing (a per-request
signature over method/path/headers/body/timestamp), which can't be
relayed as a static header. Bedrock is handled by a ``prepare_request``
hook on its rule.

The hook supports two Bedrock surfaces, selected by URL prefix the
worker addresses:

  * **Mantle** (default) — ``bedrock-mantle.<region>.api.aws/
    anthropic/v1/messages``.  Native Anthropic Messages API with bare
    model IDs (``anthropic.claude-opus-4-8``), native SSE streaming,
    tool use, prompt caching.  Workers point at
    ``http://_/bedrock/mantle`` (or the unprefixed ``http://_/bedrock``
    for backward compatibility).  The worker's ``/v1/messages`` path
    is rewritten to Mantle's ``/anthropic/v1/messages``; the body's
    ``anthropic_version`` is filled in when missing.

  * **Runtime** (legacy InvokeModel) — ``bedrock-runtime.<region>.
    amazonaws.com/model/<id>/invoke``.  Required for models not yet
    on Mantle, for cross-region inference profile IDs
    (``us.``/``eu.``/``global.``), and for compliance-pinned
    ARN-versioned IDs.  Workers point at ``http://_/bedrock/runtime``.
    The body's ``model`` field is moved into the URL path and
    ``anthropic_version`` filled in.  Non-streaming only — operators
    wanting streaming should use Mantle.

For both surfaces, the hook attaches auth in one of two modes:

  * **Bedrock API key** (``AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK``) — a static
    ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` header. No botocore, no signing;
    same shape as every other bearer provider. Takes precedence over
    SigV4 when present (matching the AWS SDKs). Needs a region only for
    the regional host.
  * **SigV4** — sign the request with the parent's AWS credentials
    via botocore's ``SigV4Auth`` (access key / secret / session token,
    or the resolved profile/SSO/IMDS chain).

The worker keeps using the plain Anthropic SDK with no boto3 in its
address space, and the parent's ``AWS_*`` secrets (keys and bearer token)
are read-and-erased at ``CredentialStore`` construction like every other
provider key — so they never flow to spawned workers. ``botocore`` is an
optional, parent-only dependency needed **only for the SigV4 mode**; the
bearer-token mode works without it. When no usable auth (or region)
resolves, the bedrock rule reports ``503 provider not configured`` like
any unconfigured provider.

Out of scope for the proxy-based dispatcher:

  * **GCP Vertex AI** — uses OAuth refresh from a service-account
    JSON file (``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``). The dispatcher
    would need ``google-auth`` integration to refresh the bearer
    token at request time. Deferred to a focused follow-up; until
    then ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` flows through env to
    workers and the SDK does its own OAuth exchange.

    rule-construction time — lets the parent rotate keys without

    ``strip_request_headers`` removes any auth-shaped header the worker
    might have added (the SDK is given a dummy key but might still echo
