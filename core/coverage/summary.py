"""Coverage — per-run tool EXECUTION detail (record-backed).

Coverage *state* (what's examined, verdicts, kinds, %) is owned by the
persistent store and rendered by ``store_summary.py`` (the single coverage
report). This module holds the complementary per-run *execution* detail read
from the ``coverage-<tool>.json`` records — which files each tool examined, the
rules/packs it applied, files it failed to process, and the Semgrep
policy-group validation — shown alongside the store-backed report rather than
folded into it (run-scoped diagnostics, not durable coverage). Also home to
``_match_to_inventory`` (path normalisation shared with the importer).
