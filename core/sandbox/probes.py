"""Availability probes for the user-namespace layers.

`check_net_available()` tests `unshare --user --net`; `check_mount_available()`
tests bind-mount capability (requires uidmap + no AppArmor restriction).
Both results are cached per-process — the cost of probing is a subprocess
spawn, done at most once.

Landlock and seccomp have their own probes in landlock.py and seccomp.py

    performs (``unshare --user --pid --fork --ipc [--net]``). On rootless
    podman / distrobox (nested userns) the narrow probe can pass while the
    full flag-set fails — the wrapper then exits BEFORE exec, the target
    command never runs, and the run silently returns empty output, which a
    consumer reads as "0 findings". This runs the ACTUAL flag-set against
    ``true`` so engagement is decided by the same kernel capability the
    real run depends on. Namespace creation is a deterministic kernel
    check (not data-dependent), so a pass here means the real wrapper will
    engage too.
