"""Pytest fixtures for the sandbox test module.

The sandbox module has several pieces of process-level global state that
can leak between tests if a setUp/tearDown is forgotten or fails. We
snapshot them before every test and restore afterwards as a safety net
— individual tests are still free to mutate them deliberately.

def _sandbox_state_guard():
    """Snapshot and restore all mutable module state around each test, so a
    test that sets any global can't poison others.

    Covers:
    - CLI-override flags (_cli_sandbox_*)
    - Once-per-process warning flags (_landlock_warned_*, _sandbox_unavailable_warned)
    - Availability caches (_net_available_cache, _mount_available_cache,
      _user_limits_cache) — tests that mock check_net_available or
      override _CONFIG_PATH would otherwise leave a stale False/{}
      value that subsequent tests see as real state. NOTE:
      _landlock_cache is INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED — see the comment
      next to its slot in state_names below for why.
    - summary._active_run_dir — the per-run sandbox-summary recording
      target. Test files have their own per-test fixtures that set/clear
      this, but a forgotten cleanup would leak the run dir into
      subsequent tests' record_denial calls (silently writing into a
      stale dir). Snapshotting in the conftest is a backstop.

    Runs automatically for every test in this directory (autouse=True).
